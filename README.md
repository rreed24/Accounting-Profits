### Interested in Accounting? There's a job market for you, but not all jobs are the same.

This cluster analysis explores the difference in Accounting incomes by Job Title as well as Employers. 
What promotion does one need to earn their desired income? What type of employer will pay their employees more?

Using data from Baltimore City Salary Data, Jobs were limited to the Accounting field. This data included both the Annual and Gross income for 2017-2018. 

After running a cluster analysis on this data (see [Instructions](https://github.com/rreed24/Accounting-Profits/blob/master/MP3_Cluster_Instructions.pdf) for step-by-step explanation), unsurprisingly, as one climbs the Accounting ladder they should expect to earn more.

Cluster_3 was one standard deviation *above* the average income, earning significantly more money. Job Titles included in this cluster are "Accounting Systems Analyst," "Accountant Manager," and "Accountant Systems Admin."

Meanwhile, Cluster_1 was one standard deviation *below* the average income, earning significantly less money. Job Titles included in this cluster are mostly "Accounting Assistants."

However, every job with a shared title isn't the same. With this in mind, a second scatter plot was created, but this time with each series being a different type of employer.

The strongest guarantee of earning a higher income is to work with an employer designated for Financial Work (Accounting or Payroll).

Some employers, such as the Police Department, are able to compensate up to $93,500.00 to their Accountants. However, the chances of earning this amount within this division are slim.
